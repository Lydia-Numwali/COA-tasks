COA Taskforce take home challenge

This repository contains the following tasks that were given through the application process of the 12-week COA Professional Training Program *TASKFORCE PRO*
So, there is a folder called coding_challenges which has two javascript files:
arrayMap.js which contains a function of checking if the array given contains a subarray whose elements sum is the same as the target give.
The target must be a random number entered by the user.
To run the script, simply run the following command
>node arrayMap.js
You will be requested to enter the elements of the array and then the target. Then if the array generated contains a subarray whose elements sum is the same as the target the answer will be True and if not the answer will be False.
The next file is the stringTransform.js. Which contains a function of string manipulation.
Run it the same way as the arrayMap.js.

There's also another folder that contains one html file,css and javascript. 
To run it you can simply right  click on the html file and choose Open with Live Server if you have live server extension enabled.
Or click on Run code icon in Visual Studio Code IDE.
